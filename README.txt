This package contains demonstrations with necessary files for computing various folding maps using alternating Beltrami equation.

Demos are inside the Example folder. They should be ready to run and easy to understand. There are some ad-hoc utility functions which may not be well documented. But they are not important and not likely to be used elsewhere anyway.
